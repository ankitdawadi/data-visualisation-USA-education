A chloropeth map for the education status of adult in different counties of USA



In this map we take the path information of different counties of the USA. We use HTML canvas to draw the state diagram using the path given in the data. Also the percentage of bachelors completion in each county was taken and later using two data set a chloropleth map of USA was visualised. 

This project was done as a part of free code camp training. All the data were provided by the free code camp.
